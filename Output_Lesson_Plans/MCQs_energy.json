      "question": "A lamp consumes 1000 J of electrical energy in 10 seconds. What is its power?",
      "options": {
        "A": "10 W",
        "B": "100 W",
        "C": "1000 W",
        "D": "10000 W"
      },
      "correct_answer": "100 W",
      "explanation": "Power is calculated as energy divided by time. Therefore, 1000 J / 10 s = 100 W."
